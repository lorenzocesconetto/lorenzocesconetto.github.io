## Who I am

I'm a software engineer based in Brazil. I have a wide variety of experiences, from Backend and DevOps to Data Science, Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

I am passionate about the intersection of Computer Science, Mathematics and AI.

I am particularly attracted to NLP applications.

## Why I started this blog

I enjoy diving very deep when learning new things. I can only truly understand a new concept once I fully understand its inner workings.

I believe there are other like-minded people around the world. If you're one of them, hopefully you'll find my content insightful.

Most AI content on the internet is rather superficial, so I decided to share my way of seeing the world.

Besides that:

- Connect with other like-minded folks
- Document my learnings
- Force myself to write things down
